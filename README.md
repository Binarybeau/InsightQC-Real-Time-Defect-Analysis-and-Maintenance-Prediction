# InsightQC-Real-Time-Defect-Analysis-and-Maintenance-Prediction
InsightQC is an innovative quality control solution designed for the additive manufacturing industry, focusing on defect detection and maintenance scheduling using machine learning and computer vision technologies. The platform helps detect surface defects, predict maintenance needs, and streamline the quality control process.
# 🎯 Key Highlights

  🧠 YOLOv8 for accurate real-time defect detection
  📊 Automated Excel Reports to visualize defect frequency
  🤖 RPA Integration with UiPath for dynamic maintenance scheduling
  📂 Roboflow integration for dataset management and training
  💡 Boosts quality assurance and reduces production downtime

# ⚙️ Project Workflow

  1.Input: Capture or upload 3D-printed product images
  2.Detection: YOLOv8 detects and classifies visible surface defects
  3.Data Logging: Defect data is stored in an Excel file using Pandas
  4.Visualization: Charts are generated to analyze defect trends
  5.Automation: UiPath bot reads data and schedules maintenance         based on frequency
